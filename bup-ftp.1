.SH NAME
.PP
bup\-ftp \- ftp\-like client for navigating bup repositories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup ftp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ ftp\f[] is a command\-line tool for navigating bup
repositories.
It has commands similar to the Unix \f[C]ftp\f[](1) command.
The file hierarchy is the same as that shown by \f[C]bup\-fuse\f[](1)
and \f[C]bup\-ls\f[](1).
.PP
Note: if your system has the python\-readline library installed, you can
use the <tab> key to complete filenames while navigating your backup
data.
This will save you a lot of typing.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
The following commands are available inside \f[C]bup\ ftp\f[]:
.TP
.B ls [\-s] [\-a] [\f[I]path\f[]]

If no path argument is given, the current directory\[aq]s contents are
listed.
If \-a is given, also include hidden files (files which start with a
\f[C]\&.\f[] character).
If \-s is given, each file is displayed with its hash from the bup
archive to its left.
