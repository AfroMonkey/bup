.SH NAME
.PP
bup\-join \- concatenate files from a bup repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup join [\-r \f[I]host\f[]:\f[I]path\f[]] [refs or hashes...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ join\f[] is roughly the opposite operation to
\f[C]bup\-split\f[](1).
You can use it to retrieve the contents of a file from a local or remote
bup repository.
.PP
The supplied list of refs or hashes can be in any format accepted by
\f[C]git\f[](1), including branch names, commit ids, tree ids, or blob
ids.
.PP
If no refs or hashes are given on the command line, \f[C]bup\ join\f[]
reads them from stdin instead.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-remote=\f[I]host\f[]:\f[I]path\f[]
Retrieves objects from the given remote repository instead of the local
one.
\f[I]path\f[] may be blank, in which case the default remote repository
is used.
The connection to the remote server is made with SSH.
If you\[aq]d like to specify which port, user or private key to use for
the SSH connection, we recommend you use the \f[C]~/.ssh/config\f[]
file.
Even though the data source is remote, a local bup repository is still
required.
