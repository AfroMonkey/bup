.SH NAME
.PP
bup\-ls \- list the contents of a bup repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup ls [OPTION...] <paths...>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ ls\f[] lists files and directories in your bup repository
using the same directory hierarchy as they would have with
\f[C]bup\-fuse\f[](1).
.PP
The top level directory contains the branch (corresponding to the
\f[C]\-n\f[] option in \f[C]bup\ save\f[]), the next level is the date
of the backup, and subsequent levels correspond to files in the backup.
.PP
When \f[C]bup\ ls\f[] is asked to output on a tty, and \f[C]\-l\f[] is
not specified, it formats the output in columns so it can list as much
as possible in as few lines as possible.
However, when \f[C]\-l\f[] is specified or bup is asked to output to
something other than a tty (say you pipe the output to another command,
or you redirect it to a file), it will print one file name per line.
This makes the listing easier to parse with external tools.
.PP
Note that \f[C]bup\ ls\f[] doesn\[aq]t show hidden files by default and
one needs to use the \f[C]\-a\f[] option to show them.
Files are hidden when their name begins with a dot.
For example, on the topmost level, the special directories named
\f[C]\&.commit\f[] and \f[C]\&.tag\f[] are hidden directories.
.PP
Once you have identified the file you want using \f[C]bup\ ls\f[], you
can view its contents using \f[C]bup\ join\f[] or \f[C]git\ show\f[].
