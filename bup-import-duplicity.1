.SH NAME
.PP
bup\-import\-duplicity \- import duplicity backups
.SH WARNING
.PP
bup\-import\-duplicity is \f[B]EXPERIMENTAL\f[] (proceed with caution)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup import\-duplicity [\-n] <source\-url> <save\-name>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ import\-duplicity\f[] imports all of the duplicity backups at
\f[C]source\-url\f[] into \f[C]bup\f[] via
\f[C]bup\ save\ \-n\ save\-name\f[].
The bup saves will have the same timestamps (via
\f[C]bup\ save\ \-\-date\f[]) as the original backups.
.PP
Because this command operates by restoring each duplicity backup to a
temporary directory, the extent to which the metadata is preserved will
depend on the characteristics of the underlying filesystem, whether or
not you run \f[C]import\-duplicity\f[] as root (or under
\f[C]fakeroot\f[](1)), etc.
.PP
Note that this command will use
\f[C]mkdtemp\f[] (https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mkdtemp)
to create temporary directories, which means that it should respect any
\f[C]TEMPDIR\f[], \f[C]TEMP\f[], or \f[C]TMP\f[] environment variable
settings.
Make sure that the relevant filesystem has enough space for the largest
duplicity backup being imported.
.PP
Since all invocations of duplicity use a temporary
\f[C]\-\-archive\-dir\f[], \f[C]import\-duplicity\f[] should not affect
~/.cache/duplicity.
