.SH NAME
.PP
bup\-server \- the server side of the bup client\-server relationship
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ server\f[] is the server side of a remote bup session.
If you use \f[C]bup\-split\f[](1) or \f[C]bup\-save\f[](1) with the
\f[C]\-r\f[] option, they will ssh to the remote server and run
\f[C]bup\ server\f[] to receive the transmitted objects.
.PP
There is normally no reason to run \f[C]bup\ server\f[] yourself.
.SH MODES
.TP
.B smart
In this mode, the server checks each incoming object against the idx
files in its repository.
If any object already exists, it tells the client about the idx file it
was found in, allowing the client to download that idx and avoid sending
duplicate data.
This is \f[C]bup\-server\f[]'s default mode.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B dumb
In this mode, the server will not check its local index before writing
an object.
To avoid writing duplicate objects, the server will tell the client to
download all of its \f[C]\&.idx\f[] files at the start of the session.
This mode is useful on low powered server hardware (ie router/slow NAS).
