bup\-tick \- wait for up to one second
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup tick
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ tick\f[] waits until \f[C]time\f[](2) returns a different
value than it originally did.
Since time() has a granularity of one second, this can cause a delay of
up to one second.
.PP
This program is useful for writing tests that need to ensure a file date
will be seen as modified.
It is slightly better than \f[C]sleep\f[](1) since it sometimes waits
for less than one second.
