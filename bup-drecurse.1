.SH NAME
.PP
bup\-drecurse \- recursively list files in your filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup drecurse [\-x] [\-q] [\-\-exclude \f[I]path\f[]]
\ [\-\-exclude\-from \f[I]filename\f[]] [\-\-exclude\-rx
\f[I]pattern\f[]] \ [\-\-exclude\-rx\-from \f[I]filename\f[]]
[\-\-profile] <path>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ drecurse\f[] traverses files in the filesystem in a way
similar to \f[C]find\f[](1).
In most cases, you should use \f[C]find\f[](1) instead.
.PP
This program is useful mainly for testing the file traversal algorithm
used in \f[C]bup\-index\f[](1).
.PP
Note that filenames are returned in reverse alphabetical order, as in
\f[C]bup\-index\f[](1).
This is important because you can\[aq]t generate the hash of a parent
directory until you have generated the hashes of all its children.
When listing files in reverse order, the parent directory will come
after its children, making this easy.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-xdev, \-\-one\-file\-system
don\[aq]t cross filesystem boundaries \-\- though as with tar and rsync,
the mount points themselves will still be reported.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
don\[aq]t print filenames as they are encountered.
Useful when testing performance of the traversal algorithms.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-exclude=\f[I]path\f[]
exclude \f[I]path\f[] from the backup (may be repeated).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-exclude\-from=\f[I]filename\f[]
read \-\-exclude paths from \f[I]filename\f[], one path per\-line (may
be repeated).
Ignore completely empty lines.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-exclude\-rx=\f[I]pattern\f[]
exclude any path matching \f[I]pattern\f[].
See \f[C]bup\-index\f[](1) for details, but note that unlike index,
drecurse will produce relative paths if the drecurse target is a
relative path.
(may be repeated).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-exclude\-rx\-from=\f[I]filename\f[]
read \-\-exclude\-rx patterns from \f[I]filename\f[], one pattern
per\-line (may be repeated).
Ignore completely empty lines.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-profile
print profiling information upon completion.
Useful when testing performance of the traversal algorithms.
