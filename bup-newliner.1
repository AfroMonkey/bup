.PP
bup\-newliner \- make sure progress messages don\[aq]t overlap with
output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
<any command> 2>&1 | bup newliner
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ newliner\f[] is run automatically by bup.
You shouldn\[aq]t need it unless you\[aq]re using it in some other
program.
.PP
Progress messages emitted by bup (and some other tools) are of the form
"Message ### content\\r", that is, a status message containing a
variable\-length number, followed by a carriage return character and no
newline.
If these messages are printed more than once, they overwrite each other,
so what the user sees is a single line with a continually\-updating
number.
.PP
This works fine until some other message is printed.
For example, progress messages are usually printed to stderr, but other
program messages might be printed to stdout.
If those messages are shorter than the progress message line, the screen
will be left with weird looking artifacts as the two messages get mixed
together.
.PP
\f[C]bup\ newliner\f[] prints extra space characters at the right time
to make sure that doesn\[aq]t happen.
.PP
If you\[aq]re running a program that has problems with these artifacts,
you can usually fix them by piping its stdout \f[I]and\f[] its stderr
through bup newliner.
.SH BUP

Part of the \f[C]bup\f[](1) suite.
