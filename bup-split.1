.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ split\f[] concatenates the contents of the given files (or if
no filenames are given, reads from stdin), splits the content into
chunks of around 8k using a rolling checksum algorithm, and saves the
chunks into a bup repository.
Chunks which have previously been stored are not stored again (ie.
they are `deduplicated').
.PP
Because of the way the rolling checksum works, chunks tend to be very
stable across changes to a given file, including adding, deleting, and
changing bytes.
.PP
For example, if you use \f[C]bup\ split\f[] to back up an XML dump of a
database, and the XML file changes slightly from one run to the next,
nearly all the data will still be deduplicated and the size of each
backup after the first will typically be quite small.
.PP
Another technique is to pipe the output of the \f[C]tar\f[](1) or
\f[C]cpio\f[](1) programs to \f[C]bup\ split\f[].
When individual files in the tarball change slightly or are added or
removed, bup still processes the remainder of the tarball efficiently.
(Note that \f[C]bup\ save\f[] is usually a more efficient way to
accomplish this, however.)
.PP
To get the data back, use \f[C]bup\-join\f[](1).
.SH MODES
.PP
These options select the primary behavior of the command, with \-n being
the most likely choice.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-name=\f[I]name\f[]
after creating the dataset, create a git branch named \f[I]name\f[] so
that it can be accessed using that name.
If \f[I]name\f[] already exists, the new dataset will be considered a
descendant of the old \f[I]name\f[].
(Thus, you can continually create new datasets with the same name, and
later view the history of that dataset to see how it has changed over
time.) The original data will also be available as a top\-level file
named \[lq]data\[rq] in the VFS, accessible via \f[C]bup\ fuse\f[],
\f[C]bup\ ftp\f[], etc.

.TP
.B \-t, \-\-tree
output the git tree id of the resulting dataset.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-commit
output the git commit id of the resulting dataset.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-blobs
output a series of git blob ids that correspond to the chunks in the
dataset.
Incompatible with \-n, \-t, and \-c.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-noop
read the data and split it into blocks based on the \[lq]bupsplit\[rq]
rolling checksum algorithm, but don't do anything with the blocks.
This is mostly useful for benchmarking.
Incompatible with \-n, \-t, \-c, and \-b.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-copy
like \f[C]\-\-noop\f[], but also write the data to stdout.
This can be useful for benchmarking the speed of read+bupsplit+write for
large amounts of data.
Incompatible with \-n, \-t, \-c, and \-b.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-remote=\f[I]host\f[]:\f[I]path\f[]
save the backup set to the given remote server.
If \f[I]path\f[] is omitted, uses the default path on the remote server
(you still need to include the `:').
The connection to the remote server is made with SSH.
If you'd like to specify which port, user or private key to use for the
SSH connection, we recommend you use the \f[C]~/.ssh/config\f[] file.
Even though the destination is remote, a local bup repository is still
required.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-date=\f[I]seconds\-since\-epoch\f[]
specify the date inscribed in the commit (seconds since 1970\-01\-01).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
disable progress messages.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
increase verbosity (can be used more than once).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-git\-ids
stdin is a list of git object ids instead of raw data.
\f[C]bup\ split\f[] will read the contents of each named git object (if
it exists in the bup repository) and split it.
This might be useful for converting a git repository with large binary
files to use bup\-style hashsplitting instead.
This option is probably most useful when combined with
\f[C]\-\-keep\-boundaries\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-keep\-boundaries
if multiple filenames are given on the command line, they are normally
concatenated together as if the content all came from a single file.
That is, the set of blobs/trees produced is identical to what it would
have been if there had been a single input file.
However, if you use \f[C]\-\-keep\-boundaries\f[], each file is split
separately.
You still only get a single tree or commit or series of blobs, but each
blob comes from only one of the files; the end of one of the input files
always ends a blob.

.B \-\-bench

.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-max\-pack\-size=\f[I]bytes\f[]
never create git packfiles larger than the given number of bytes.
Default is 1 billion bytes.
Usually there is no reason to change this.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-max\-pack\-objects=\f[I]numobjs\f[]
never create git packfiles with more than the given number of objects.
Default is 200 thousand objects.
Usually there is no reason to change this.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-fanout=\f[I]numobjs\f[]
when splitting very large files, try and keep the number of elements in
trees to an average of \f[I]numobjs\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-bwlimit=\f[I]bytes/sec\f[]
don't transmit more than \f[I]bytes/sec\f[] bytes per second to the
server.
This is good for making your backups not suck up all your network
bandwidth.
Use a suffix like k, M, or G to specify multiples of 1024,
1024\f[I]1024, 1024\f[]1024*1024 respectively.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\f[I]#\f[], \-\-compress=\f[I]#\f[]
set the compression level to # (a value from 0\-9, where 9 is the
highest and 0 is no compression).
The default is 1 (fast, loose compression)
